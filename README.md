1) When you work with a compiled language, the code is converted directly into the machine code that the processor can execute. On the other hand, an interpreted language, must be read and translated by another program in order in order to be executed by the processor.
2) Java source code is compiled down to bytecode by the Java compiler. The bytecode is executed by a Java Virtual Machine. So we can say that JavaScript is both compiled and interpreted language.
3) 1. START
   2. PRINT " How much dollars (USD) do you want to convert to Bitcoin (BTC)?"
